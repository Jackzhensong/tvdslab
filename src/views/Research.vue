          Post-Doctoral Positions in Statistical Learning for Data Science<br />
          Post-Doctoral Position (2 Years) in the Time-varying Data Science
          Group of Prof. Ercan E Kuruoglu, Institute of Information and Data
          Science and Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute of Tsinghua
          University Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, China.
          This will start from 1 September 2023 and applications are considered
          until the positions are filled.

          Postdoc 1: Topological Data Analysis for Statistical Learning<br />
          Keywords: Topological data analysis, graph machine learning,
          time-varying graph analysis, rare event modelling <br />
          The objective is to develop ground-breaking topological signal
          processing and statistical learning methods for high-dimensional data.
          The focus lies on conducting fundamental research to derive scalable
          methods with robustness and statistical guarantees that form a bridge
          between existing topological data analysis methods and statistical
          learning methods with an eye on applications with time-varying data.
          Various applications including climate data, financial data, genomic
          data will be considered though the main emphasis will be in
          methodology development.<br />

          Postdoc 2: Stochastic deep learning <br />
          Keywords: Bayesian machine learning, non-stationary data analysis<br />
          This project aims to develop a deep learning methodology which is
          dynamic and statistical at the same time, that is non-deterministic
          and non-stationary. We will explore various methods from signal
          processing extending them to nonlinear systems and hence applying to
          neural networks.<br />
