          <a href="index.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>TVDS Group</a> aims at studying time evolution in data
          science. Our research interests include Statistical Signal Processing, Bayesian Learning,
          Computational Biology and Geosciences, Remote Sensing, etc. We are looking for the people with the same
          interest!<br />

            <p>Post-Doctoral Positions in Statistical Learning for Data Science<br />
              Post-Doctoral Position (2 Years) in the Time-varying Data Science Group of Prof. Ercan E Kuruoglu,
              Institute of Information and Data Science and Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute of Tsinghua University
              Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, China. This will start from 1 September 2023 and
              applications are considered until the positions are filled. <br />

            <p>Postdoc 1: Topological Data Analysis for Statistical Learning<br />
              Keywords: Topological data analysis, graph machine learning, time-varying graph analysis, rare event
              modelling<br />
              The objective is to develop ground-breaking topological signal processing and statistical learning methods
              for high-dimensional data. The focus lies on conducting fundamental research to derive scalable methods
              with robustness and statistical guarantees that form a bridge between existing topological data analysis
              methods and statistical learning methods with an eye on applications with time-varying data. Various
              applications including climate data, financial data, genomic data will be considered though the main
              emphasis will be in methodology development.<br />

            <p>Postdoc 2: Stochastic deep learning <br />
              Keywords: Bayesian machine learning, non-stationary data analysis<br />
              This project aims to develop a deep learning methodology which is dynamic and statistical at the same
              time, that is non-deterministic and non-stationary. We will explore various methods from signal processing
              extending them to nonlinear systems and hence applying to neural networks.<br />
              <br />

              Applicants should have, e.g., a PhD in electrical or electronics or information engineering with a
              specialization in signal processing or statistical learning, or a PhD in mathematics (topology,
              statistics, functional analysis). You should have a track record in your research field, as evidenced by
              publications in top quality journals. To apply for this position, please send your CV, a one-page personal
              statement, full contact details of two referees, transcripts and publications to
              kuruoglu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn
